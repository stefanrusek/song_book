# Specification Quality Checklist: Polish SDA Hymnal Songbook Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (only 1, acceptable - usage pattern validation)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Passed**: All quality checks passed successfully.

**Minor Note**: One NEEDS VALIDATION marker exists for "Users will access the application primarily on mobile devices during services" - This is acceptable as it's marked for post-launch monitoring and doesn't block implementation.

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.
